# Debugging Guide for Sketch to 3D

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Arabic Language Switching Not Working Locally

**Problem:** The language switching to Arabic wasn't working properly when running the site locally.

**Solution:**
- Added page reload after language change to ensure all elements update correctly
- Improved the RTL adjustment function to handle class-based margin changes more robustly
- Added console logging to help debug RTL adjustments
- Ensured language settings are applied consistently across all pages

### 2. High Contrast Mode Not Working Locally

**Problem:** High contrast mode wasn't being applied correctly when running locally.

**Solution:**
- Added explicit initialization of high contrast mode on page load
- Improved the high contrast toggle functionality
- Ensured high contrast settings are applied early in the page load process
- Added consistent high contrast handling across all pages

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Language Switching:**
   - Click the language switcher icon in the header
   - Select "العربية" (Arabic)
   - The page should reload and display in RTL mode
   - Text direction and margins should adjust accordingly
   - Switching back to English should restore LTR layout

2. **High Contrast Mode:**
   - Click the accessibility icon in the header
   - Select "Enable High Contrast"
   - The page should immediately switch to high contrast mode
   - Colors should change to provide higher contrast
   - Toggling it off should restore normal colors

## Additional Debugging Tips

If you encounter further issues:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors in the Console tab
   - The improved code adds console logging for RTL adjustments

2. **Inspect localStorage:**
   - In developer tools, go to Application > Storage > Local Storage
   - Verify that the following keys are being set correctly:
     - `language` (should be "en" or "ar")
     - `highContrast` (should be "true" or "false")
     - `theme` (should be "light" or "dark")

3. **Clear Cache and Storage:**
   - If issues persist, try clearing your browser cache and localStorage
   - In developer tools: Application > Storage > Clear Site Data
   - Then refresh the page and test again

4. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   - Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Different browsers may handle localStorage and CSS differently

## Deployment Recommendations

When deploying to production:

1. **Use a CDN for Static Assets:**
   - Consider using a CDN for faster loading of static assets
   - Update image paths to use absolute URLs or CDN paths

2. **Enable CORS if Needed:**
   - If fetching resources from different domains, ensure CORS is properly configured

3. **Test on Multiple Devices:**
   - Test the site on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
   - Ensure responsive design works correctly across all screen sizes

4. **Accessibility Testing:**
   - Use tools like Lighthouse or axe to test accessibility compliance
   - Ensure high contrast mode meets WCAG guidelines
